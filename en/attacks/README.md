# Threats to the SAFE Network

The SAFE Network, like any network that handles data and important information, is open to attack. These attacks could be for malicious reasons or, more typically, for financial gain.

If an attacker can access a user's data and even decrypt their files, they could then request payment to prevent deleting or selling-on  the user's data.

The SAFE Network has been designed to resist, or completely remove, the potential damage that can be caused by the most common attack methods.

Security improvements to the SAFE Network are constantly being developed and enhanced.
