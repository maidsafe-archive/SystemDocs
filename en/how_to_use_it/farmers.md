# A Farmer

As a user of the SAFE Network, a Farmer installs the SAFE Network client and provides unused computer resources to the network such as storage, CPU processing, and bandwidth.

These resources are used to securely and anonymously comprise the SAFE Network, replacing data centres that constitute the current centralised Internet. This is done using the local Vault on the Farmer's computer, which is installed as part of the download process and configured using the SAFE Network client.

When the resources provided exceed the network average the Farmer earns safecoins in exchange for providing these resources. This is indicated to the Farmer by a notification from the SAFE Network client.

The safecoins earned are credited to the Farmers account and can then be used by the Farmer, for example, by exchanging them for additional storage.

The Farmer can also run apps and programs which have been designed for use on the SAFE Network.
