# Safecoins
Safecoins are the currency of the SAFE Network. They are a token-based scheme that is only used inside the SAFE Network. Safecoins are used for buying additional resources, for example, storage space, or access to network applications. All safecoins are saved in a user's wallet.

When a user provides space for the SAFE Network that is greater than the amount they use, they start to earn safecoins. This is called farming and a user who farms is called a Farmer. With safecoins, a user can buy more storage, exchange them for network services, reward content creators, or exchange them for another currency (or cash) using a SAFE Network exchange.

Transfers of safecoins between users is managed automatically by Transaction managers. The Transaction managers are Vault personas whose priority is to ensure that safecoins are digitally signed and are never deleted or corrupted.

As there can be multiple Transaction managers coordinating different safecoins transactions at the same time, an unrestricted number of transactions can take place at network speed.

A safecoin is a piece of digital information. The only historical data held with a safecoin is the current and previous owner's details. These details are used for verification purposes. This means that safecoins can be thought of as digital cash, leaving no audit trail.

As the network grows, the amount of available safecoins also grows. This means that the amount of safecoins available is directly linked to the amount of resource available in the SAFE Network. As a result the value of the safecoin is maintained and is relative to the network size.
